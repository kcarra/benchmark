### Benchmark

Benchmark is a personal project to help understand more about the internals of SSR (server-side rendering). It is heavily inspired by [clockwork](https://github.com/itsgoingd/clockwork) and my goal is to create something similar for SSR JS apps. To start, benchmark will be built to work with SSR React apps build using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/), but this will probably be expanded in the future. Ideally benchmark would be able to be brought into any SSR JS app independent of framework and tooling.

### Insights Benchmark will provide

Initially benchmark will be built to live on the server, either as middleware or completly independent. It will be used to provide insight into the SSR process. Initial functionality that I will be working on:

- Component render time - How long does it take the server to render the server component and the size of the rendered component

- Network calls - From my understanding one of the primary use cases for server components is to make network calls (fetch data) on the server. Traditionally with client components we would use the network tab to dissect these calls; latency, headers, response, etc. Benchmark will provide a way to preview those calls similarly to how we currently do it in the browser.

- Future ideas...

### Contributing

If others find this concept interesting and want to contribute I would be happy to collaborate! ðŸŽ‰
